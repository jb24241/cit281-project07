# CIT281 Project 7

## Overview

Project goals and outcomes:

1. Gain more experience working with GitHub repos.
2. Gain experience working with GitHub Pages.
3. Create an initial CIT Minor portfolio for your labs and projects.

## Deliverables

- `lab-08.zip`
- `lab-09.zip`
- `p7.txt`

These files should be placed in your `cit281/p7` folder and zipped into `p7.zip`.

## Summary

In Project 7, the primary focus was on creating a portfolio to showcase the labs and projects completed during the CIT 281 course. This involved working extensively with GitHub Pages to create a user-level or organization-level entry page, and individual pages for each lab and project.

### Project Structure

1. **Main GitHub Page**:
    - Created an entry GitHub Page with a selected theme.
    - Updated `_config.yml` with a title and description reflecting the portfolio's purpose.
    - Replaced the initial `README.md` with a list of CIT 281 labs and projects, each containing a description and links to the respective repositories.
    - Added images to enhance the page's visual appeal.

2. **Lab and Project Repositories**:
    - Created individual repositories for each of the nine labs and seven projects.
    - Enabled GitHub Pages for each repository, selecting the same theme as the main page.
    - Added significant details to each page, discussing the lab or project's purpose, technologies used, and lessons learned.
    - Encouraged the use of images and screen captures to make the pages more interesting and unique.

3. **Git and GitHub Lab and Project Repo Code**:
    - Uploaded the source code for all projects to their respective GitHub repositories.
    - Uploaded the source code for all labs to their respective GitHub repositories.
    - Documented all projects and uploaded project code. Documentation for each lab was required, with optional lab code uploads.

### Entry GitHub Page URL

- A file named `p7.txt` was created, containing the full URL to the GitHub Page.

### Project Steps

1. **Completed Lab 8**:
    - Ensure `lab-08.zip` is saved in `cit281/p7`.

2. **Completed Lab 9**:
    - Ensure `lab-09.zip` is saved in `cit281/p7`.

3. **Create Main GitHub Page**:
    - Follow steps to create a user-level or organization-level entry page.
    - Update `_config.yml` and `README.md` with relevant details.
    - Add images to enhance the page.

4. **Create Lab and Project Repositories**:
    - Create individual repositories for each lab and project.
    - Name repositories as `cit281-lab#` and `cit281-p#`.

5. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    - Enable GitHub Pages for each lab and project repository.
    - Add significant details, images, and screen captures to each page.

6. **Upload Code**:
    - Add lab and project code to corresponding repositories.
    - Document all projects and upload project code. Optionally add lab code.

### Project Deliverables

- `lab-08.zip`
- `lab-09.zip`
- `p7.txt`
